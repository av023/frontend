    <h2> ___INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES___</h2>
   <p>Great photography is about depth of feeling, not depth of field.<br/>
     <b>– Peter Adams</b><p>
    <p>Look and think before opening the shutter. The heart and mind are the true lens of the camera.<br/>
      <b>– Yousuf Karsh</b></p>
    <p>Photography is not about the thing photographed. It is about how that thing looks photographed.</br>
      <b> – Garry Winogrand</b></p>
<p>To me, photography is an art of observation. It’s about finding something interesting an ordinary place… I’ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.<br/>
